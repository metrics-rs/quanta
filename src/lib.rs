//! Performant cross-platform timing with goodies.
//!
//! `quanta` provides a simple and fast API for measuring the current time and the duration between
//! events.  It does this by providing a thin layer on top of native OS timing functions, or, if
//! available, using the Time Stamp Counter feature found on modern CPUs.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Internally, `quanta` maintains the concept of two potential clock sources: a reference clock and
//! a source clock.
//!
//! The reference clock is provided by the OS, and always available.  It is equivalent to what is
//! provided by the standard library in terms of the underlying system calls being made.  As it uses
//! the native timing facilities provided by the operating system, we ultimately depend on the OS
//! itself to give us a stable and correct value.
//!
//! The source clock is a potential clock source based on the [Time Stamp Counter][tsc] feature
//! found on modern CPUs.  If the TSC feature is not present or is not reliable enough, `quanta`
//! will transparently utilize the reference clock instead.
//!
//! Depending on the underlying processor(s) in the system, `quanta` will figure out the most
//! accurate/efficient way to calibrate the source clock to the reference clock in order to provide
//! measurements scaled to wall clock time.
//!
//! Details on TSC support, and calibration, are detailed below.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! Beyond simply taking measurements of the current time, `quanta` provides features for more
//! easily working with clocks, as well as being able to enhance performance further:
//! - `Clock` can be mocked for testing
//! - globally accessible "recent" time with amortized overhead
//!
//! ## Mocked time
//!
//! For any code that uses a `Clock`, a mocked version can be substituted.  This allows for
//! application authors to control the time in tests, which allows simulating not only the normal
//! passage of time but provides the ability to warp time forwards and backwards in order to test
//! corner cases in logic, etc.  Creating a mocked clock can be acheived with [`Clock::mock`], and
//! [`Mock`] contains more details on mock usage.
//!
//! ## Coarsely-updated, or recent, time
//!
//! `quanta` also provides a "recent" time feature, which allows a slightly-delayed version of time
//! to be provided to callers, trading accuracy for speed of access.  An upkeep thread is spawned,
//! which is responsible for taking measurements and updating the global recent time. Callers then
//! can access the cached value by calling `Clock::recent`.  This interface can be 4-10x faster than
//! directly calling `Clock::now`, even when TSC support is available.  As the upkeep thread is the
//! only code updating the recent time, the accuracy of the value given to callers is limited by how
//! often the upkeep thread updates the time, thus the trade off between accuracy and speed of
//! access.
//!
//! # Feature Flags
//!
//! `quanta` comes with feature flags that enable convenient conversions to time types in other
//! popular crates, such as:
//! - `prost` - provides an implementation into [`Timestamp`][prost_types_timestamp] from
//!   `prost_types`
//!
//! # Platform Support
//!
//! At a high level, `quanta` carries support for most major operating systems out of the box:
//! - Windows ([`QueryPerformanceCounter`][QueryPerformanceCounter])
//! - macOS/OS X/iOS ([`mach_absolute_time`][mach_absolute_time])
//! - Linux/*BSD/Solaris ([`clock_gettime`][clock_gettime])
//!
//! These platforms are supported in the "reference" clock sense, and support for using the Time
//! Stamp Counter as a clocksource is more subtle, and explained below.
//!
//! ## WASM support
//!
//! This library can be built for WASM targets, but in this case the resolution and accuracy of
//! measurements can be limited by the WASM environment. In particular, when running on the
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target in browsers, `quanta` will use [windows.performance.now] as a
//! clock. This mean the accuracy is limited to milliseconds instead of the usual nanoseconds on
//! other targets. When running within a WASI environment (target `wasm32-wasi`), the accuracy of
//! the clock depends on the VM implementation.
//!
//! # TSC Support
//!
//! Accessing the TSC requires being on the `x86_64` architecture, with access to SSE2.
//! Additionally, the processor must support either constant or nonstop/invariant TSC.  This ensures
//! that the TSC ticks at a constant rate which can be easily scaled.
//!
//! A caveat is that "constant" TSC doesn't account for all possible power states (levels of power
//! down or sleep that a CPU can enter to save power under light load, etc) and so a constant TSC
//! can lead to drift in measurements over time, after they've been scaled to reference time.
//!
//! This is a limitation of the TSC mode, as well as the nature of `quanta` not being able to know,
//! as the OS would, when a power state transition has happened, and thus compensate with a
//! recalibration. Nonstop/invariant TSC does not have this limitation and is stable over long
//! periods of time.
//!
//! Roughly speaking, the following list contains the beginning model/generation of processors where
//! you should be able to expect having invariant TSC support:
//! - Intel Nehalem and newer for server-grade
//! - Intel Skylake and newer for desktop-grade
//! - VIA Centaur Nano and newer (circumstantial evidence here)
//! - AMD Phenom and newer
//!
//! Ultimately, `quanta` will query CPUID information to determine if the processor has the required
//! features to use the TSC.
//!
//! # Calibration
//!
//! As the TSC doesn't necessarily tick at reference scale -- i.e. one tick isn't always one
//! nanosecond -- we have to apply a scaling factor when converting from source to reference time
//! scale to provide this.  We acquire this scaling factor by repeatedly taking measurements from
//! both the reference and source clocks, until we have a statistically-relevant measure of the
//! average scaling factor.  We do some additional work to convert this scaling factor into a
//! power-of-two number that allows us to optimize the code, and thus reduce the generated
//! instructions required to scale a TSC value.
//!
//! This calibration is stored globally and reused.  However, the first `Clock` that is created in
//! an application will block for a small period of time as it runs this calibration loop.  The time
//! spent in the calibration loop is limited to 200ms overall.  In practice, `quanta` will reach a
//! stable calibration quickly (usually 10-20ms, if not less) and so this deadline is unlikely to be
//! reached.
//!
//! # Caveats
//!
//! Utilizing the TSC can be a tricky affair, and so here is a list of caveats that may or may not
//! apply, and is in no way exhaustive:
//! - CPU hotplug behavior is undefined
//! - raw values may time warp
//! - measurements from the TSC may drift past or behind the comparable reference clock
//!
//! Another important caveat is that `quanta` does not track time across system suspends.  Simply
//! put, if a time measurement (such as using [`Instant::now`][crate::Instant::now]) is taken, and
//! then the system is suspended, and then another measurement is taken, the difference between
//! those the two would not include the time the system was in suspend.
