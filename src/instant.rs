/// ## Monotonicity
///
/// On all platforms, `Instant` will try to use an OS API that guarantees monotonic behavior if
/// available, which is the case for all supported platforms.  In practice such guarantees are –
/// under rare circumstances – broken by hardware, virtualization or operating system bugs. To work
/// around these bugs and platforms not offering monotonic clocks [`duration_since`], [`elapsed`]
/// and [`sub`] saturate to zero. In older `quanta` versions this lead to a panic instead.
/// [`checked_duration_since`] can be used to detect and handle situations where monotonicity is
/// violated, or `Instant`s are subtracted in the wrong order.
///
/// This workaround obscures programming errors where earlier and later instants are accidentally
/// swapped. For this reason future `quanta` versions may reintroduce panics.
