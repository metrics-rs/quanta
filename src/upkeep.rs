/// Ultra-low-overhead access to slightly-delayed time.
///
/// In some applications, there can be a need to check the current time very often, so much so that
/// the overhead of checking the time can begin to eat up measurable overhead. For some of these
/// cases, the time may need to be accessed often but does not necessarily need to be incredibly
/// accurate: one millisecond granularity could be entirely acceptable.
///
/// For these cases, we provide a slightly-delayed version of the time to callers via
/// [`Clock::recent`], which is updated by a background upkeep thread.  That thread is configured
/// and spanwed via [`Upkeep`].
///
/// Given an update interval, [`Upkeep`] will faithfully attempt to update the global recent time
/// on the specified interval.  There is a trade-off to be struck in terms of how often the time is
/// updated versus the required accuracy.  Checking the time and updating the global reference is
/// itself not zero-cost, and so care must be taken to analyze the number of readers in order to
/// ensure that, given a particular update interval, the upkeep thread is saving more CPU time than
/// would be spent otherwise by directly querying the current time.
///
/// The recent time is read and written atomically.  It is global to an application, so if another
/// codepath creates the upkeep thread, the interval chosen by that instantiation will be the one
/// that all callers of [`Clock::recent`] end up using.
///
/// Multiple upkeep threads cannot exist at the same time.  A new upkeep thread can be started if
/// the old one is dropped and returns.
///
/// In terms of performance, reading the recent time can be up to two to three times as fast as
/// reading the current time in the optimized case of using the Time Stamp Counter source.  In
/// practice, while a caller might expect to take 12-14ns to read the TSC and scale it to reference
/// time, the recent time can be read in 4-5ns, with no reference scale conversion required.
